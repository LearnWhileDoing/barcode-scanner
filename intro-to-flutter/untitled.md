# What is Flutter?

> ### Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

This is how Flutter describes itself. In essence, Flutter is **a way for us to build apps for multiple platforms and devices using one coding language: Dart**.

## Benefits

Flutter lists 3 main benefits that it provides. We'll look into what each of the benefits are, what they mean, and how we can use them to our... benefit!

### Fast Development

> #### Flutter's _hot reload_ helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster. Experience sub-second reload times without losing state on emulators, simulators, and hardware.

Flutter has a very useful feature called "hot reload." It lets you run your app on your phone, make updates to the code, and instantly see the changes on your device! It lets you make changes more easily and more efficiently.

### Expressive and Flexible UI

> #### Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.

Flutter provides us with most of the styling already built-in, but it also allows us to customize our app as much as we want. This helps to create apps that not only act very fast, but look really good too!

### Native Performance

> #### Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.

As we previously discussed, native performance will make your app more pleasing to your end user as it looks much more polished. Flutter lets you acheive native performance on all platforms without coding in the native programming languages.
