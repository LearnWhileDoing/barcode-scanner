# Working with Flutter

## Introductory video

Watch the following walkthrough video of Flutter to see a developer on Google's Flutter team make some changes to an app built in Flutter! At this point in the course, you probably won't understand everything that he is doing nor saying, but this video will give you a good understanding of what coding with Flutter is like.

## "Everything is a widget"

At the beginning of that video, Martin talked about the versatility of "widgets" in Flutter.  In case you didn't catch it in the video, _**"widgets are the building blocks of Flutter."**_  They are used for everything from individual elements to entire pages of your apps. To that extent comes the phrase, "everything is a widget in Flutter." That's because, when you are working with Flutter, every part of your app—whether it be a button, a text field, a list, a text box, a navigation menu, etc.—_everything is a widget!_
