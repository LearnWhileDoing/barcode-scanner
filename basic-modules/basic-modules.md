# Basic Modules

Learn While Doing's philosophy involves breaking up courses into more digestible "basic modules" that contain material that are re-usable outside of this course. By doing so, you can apply the knowledge you learn in a basic module to any project that uses the information in that module!

Once you have completed the modules listed below, make sure you download your certificates, and we can get started with the project with the knowledge you need!
